My first project in Harvard’s CS50 course. Built using Scratch.

Baseball Swing Game

This is my first project from Harvard’s CS50 course, built using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). It’s a simple, interactive baseball game that helped me learn the basics of programming logic using visual blocks.

## 🎮 Game Overview

- A **ball (sprite 1)** continuously pitches toward the player when the green flag is clicked.
- The **batter (sprite 2)** swings when you click on it.
- If the batter hits the ball, your **score increases by 1** and a "tap tonga" sound plays.
- When your **score reaches 10**, a "goal scorer" sound plays to signal victory, and the score resets to 0 — letting you play again.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me understand several core programming concepts:

1. Adding and controlling **multiple sprites** in a single project
2. Using **forever loops** to keep the game running continuously
3. Using the **"change" block** to control ball speed
4. Using **"if" conditions** to:
   - Reset the ball’s position when it touches the screen edge
   - Detect collisions and update the score
   - Play different sounds based on the score
5. Positioning sprites with **"go to x:, y:"**
6. Creating and using **custom blocks (functions)** like `swing` for the batter
7. Switching costumes within a custom function to animate the batter's swing
